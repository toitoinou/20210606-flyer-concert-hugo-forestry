**Edward Manukyan** (born July 27, 1981) is a composer from [Southern California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California "Folklore"), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). His main works are orchestral and chamber compositions, which lean heavily upon elements of Armenian national [folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore).

Edward Manukyan's compositional style was mainly influenced by the middle-generation Soviet composers, such as [Aram Khachaturian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aram_Khachaturian "Aram Khachaturian"), [Dmitry Shostakovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Shostakovich "Dmitry Shostakovich") and [Sergey Prokofiev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Prokofiev "Sergey Prokofiev"), as well as the Armenian successors of their traditions, [Alexander Arutiunian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Arutiunian "Alexander Arutiunian"), [Edvard Mirzoyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Mirzoyan "Edvard Mirzoyan"), [Tigran Mansuryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigran_Mansuryan "Tigran Mansuryan"), etc. Later he drew influences from [Béla Bartók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k "Béla Bartók") and [Igor Stravinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky "Igor Stravinsky"), striving for a contemporary style that is accessible for larger audiences, in part due to its closeness to Armenian folk music.
